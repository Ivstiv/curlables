Every so often I happen to stumble upon one of these rare gems on the internet, so I got curious if there is a 
list of them. Unfortunately, I couldn't find any just by searching, so I started writing them down in notes whenever I find a new one. Here is a list of the ones I have found so far, if you want to add more of them just contact me or create a PR. 


## Curlable ?!
So what is a curlable? Well, the term might not actually exist but I can't seem to find a more suitable name. It is just a website that is designed to show output on the command line. Yup, that's it curl the website and start using it from your shell, rather than a browser. Of course this would also work with other HTTP clients and tools like wget etc. but curl is pretty well known at this point and also sounds a bit cooler... :D
